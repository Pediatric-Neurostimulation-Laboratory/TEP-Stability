# TEP-Stability
This repository contains MATLAB scripts that can perform TEP stability analyses

Author: Xiwei She, Ph.D.

The main script for TEP stability analyese is named TEPStabilityAnalysis_v2.m. It calls some functions saved in the folder named "toolbox" contains all necessary functions, so users should be able to run the script by downloading the entire folder. 

Note: the toolbox named "eeglab" can be downloaded separately from its official website: https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/index.php

We also provide one example dataset that can be used for testing the methodology and reproducing the MNP plot we shown in Figure 1 in the paper. However, this dataset is for testing the script only. Please do not distrbute the dataset without the permission of the authors.
